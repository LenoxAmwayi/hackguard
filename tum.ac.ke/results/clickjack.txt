ClickJacking Vulnerability:
The malicious practice of manipulating a website user's activity by concealing hyperlinks beneath legitimate clickable content, thereby causing the user to perform actions of which they are unaware.

Mitigation:
One way to defend against clickjacking is to include a "frame-breaker" script in each page that should not be framed.
